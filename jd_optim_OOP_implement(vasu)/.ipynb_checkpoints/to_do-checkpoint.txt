# JD Agent - To-Do List

## DONE ‚úÖ
- Combined AI and manual creation into one tab
- Added company info to all job descriptions
- Added same perks and benefits section to all job descriptions
- Made it so recruiters and hiring managers see the same screens
- Save created JDs as templates for later
- Added simple summaries of what each version changes
- Got resume templates from Mischelle

## TO DO üìù

### Most Important
- Focus on changing the skills/requirements section (3rd section) the most
- Get previously developed components from Dev who worked on this before
- Test the system with Sandhiya and Mischelle before wider release
- Get more resume samples with different skills and backgrounds

### Next Steps
- Make sure JD improvements keep focus on right sections:
  * First section (role): keep 90% the same
  * Second section: keep 90% the same
  * Third section (skills): change 85-90% (most important!)
  * Last section (preferred): change about 10%
